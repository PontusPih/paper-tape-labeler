# Paper Tape Labeler

This is an attempt to create a paper tape labeler for the PDP-8: 
 * Input: a glyph definition for 5-bit/pixel chars
 * Output: assembler to punch letters on paper tape, given keyboard input

# Credit

The DEC 5-bit font was borrowed from (@MattisLind)[https://github.com/MattisLind/papertapetext] and adapted to use bit 2 as terminator instead of a zero value.
